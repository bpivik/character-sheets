The clerics saw something in him: a steady hand, an unyielding spirit, and took him in as an acolyte. In time, he swore the Oath of Devotion and was anointed as a paladin.</p>\\n<p>It was during a diplomatic feast at the estate of Lord Brevane that Cassian first met <strong>Entissa;</strong>&nbsp;sharp-witted, kind beneath her courtly composure, and utterly out of his reach. What began as stolen glances became quiet conversations in moonlit gardens, then whispered confessions neither of them could take back. For one brief season, the world felt whole.</p>\\n<p>But the temple had other plans. Reports of a creeping darkness in the northern marchlands demanded a holy champion, and the high cleric of Nimue chose Cassian by name. To refuse would mean breaking his Oath, the very thing that made him worthy of Entissa\'s respect in the first place.</p>\\n<p>He left at dawn without waking her, pressing a single letter and his mother\'s iron ring into the hand of her chambermaid.</p>\\n<p>Now Cassian marches north, his shield bright and his heart heavy, carrying a quiet prayer that the light he serves will one day lead him home to her.</p>", "appearance": "Cassian is a tall, broad-shouldered man with sun-weathered skin, close-cropped dark hair, and a jaw shadowed by perpetual stubble. His steel-grey eyes carry a quiet sadness, and a thin scar traces his left brow; a memento from his days hauling iron in his father\'s forge.", "personality": "Cassian is steady and soft-spoken, the kind of man who listens more than he talks and means every word when he finally does. He leads with quiet conviction rather than grand speeches, earning trust through action \\u2014 but beneath his calm exterior lies a restless guilt, a man constantly torn between duty and the life he left behind, which sometimes makes him reckless when he feels he has nothing left to lose.", "goals": "<b>Cassian is driven by his sacred oath to destroy the darkness spreading in the north</b>, but what truly keeps him moving is the hope that completing this mission will earn him the right to return to Entissa. Beneath every noble act lies a deeply personal need to prove he is worthy: of his calling, of her love, and of the sacrifices he\'s made.", "connections": "<p><ul><li><strong>Entissa Brevane</strong> \\u2014 The noblewoman he loves, who may still be waiting for him or may have been pressured into a political marriage in his absence.</li><li><strong>High Cleric Sorath</strong> \\u2014 Cassian\'s mentor and the one who sent him north; a stern but fair leader whose approval Cassian still desperately seeks.</li><li><strong>Maren, his younger sister</strong> \\u2014 Still living in Ardenmere, running their late father\'s forge, and the only person who knows the full truth about Cassian and Entissa.</li><li><strong>Lord Brevane</strong> \\u2014 Entissa\'s father, who tolerated Cassian as a paladin of the temple but would never accept him as a suitor for his daughter.</li></ul></p>", "quests": "<p><ul><li><strong>Quest 1: The Broken Bridge at Ashwick:</strong>\\nArrived at Ashwick Crossing to find the bridge collapsed and villagers cut off from their farmland. Helped rebuild it over three days. Elder Wynn mentioned livestock vanishing in the night \\u2014 always to the north. Left a blessing of Nimue on the bridge posts before moving on.</li><li><strong>Quest 2: The Defiled Shrine in the Pallid Wood:</strong>\\nFound a shrine to Nimue deep in the Pallid Wood, cracked open and smeared with black ichor. Spent a night in prayer to reconsecrate it. Something watched me from the treeline the entire time. At dawn the birdsong returned, but only within a few hundred feet of the shrine. Whatever is out here, it\'s pushing back against the light.</li><li><strong>Quest 3: The Chanting Beneath Dunmore Keep:</strong>\\nCamped in the ruins of Dunmore Keep for shelter. Woke past midnight to rhythmic chanting echoing up through the stone floor. Found a sealed trapdoor in the old barracks but couldn\'t open it alone. Marked the location on my map. Need to come back with allies \\u2014 this feels connected to everything else.</li></ul></p>", "places": "<ul><li><strong>The Gilt Hall, Vastemere</strong> \\u2014 Resupplied here. Merchant named Pollo owes me a favor.</li><li><strong>Ashwick Crossing</strong> \\u2014 Bridge was out. Helped villagers rebuild it. They mentioned missing livestock to the north.</li><li><strong>The Pallid Wood</strong> \\u2014 Trees are wrong here. White bark, no birdsong. Found defiled shrine to Solaris half-buried in roots.</li><li><strong>Dunmore Keep (ruined)</strong> \\u2014 Abandoned garrison. Camped one night. Heard chanting below the floors. Did NOT investigate alone.</li><li><strong>Greymist Marsh</strong> \\u2014 Two days northeast of Ashwick. Locals say the darkness started here. Water smells like copper.</li><li><strong>The Shepherd\'s Rest (inn)</strong> \\u2014 Last warm bed before the marchlands. Barkeep Hild warned me not to travel past the standing stones at night.</li></ul>", "secrets": "</div></div></div></div></div><div class=\\"flex justify-start\\" role=\\"group\\" aria-label=\\"Message actions\\"></div></button></div><div class=\\"flex items-center\\"></div></div></div></div></div></div>", "journalEntries": [], "custom-1771111312151": "<p><ul><li><strong>Lyra Fenwick (Half-Elf Ranger)</strong>\\nQuiet.

Argues with me about theology around the fire. I think he enjoys it.</li><li><strong>Sable (Abyssar Rogue)</strong>\\nNo last name. No straight answers.

I don\'t trust her yet \\u2014 but she didn\'t have to pull me out of the marsh, and she did.</li><li><strong>Aldric Thorne (Human Wizard)</strong>\\nNobleman\'s son playing adventurer \\u2014 or so I thought. Watched him nearly kill himself holding a ward over our camp in the Pallid Wood. He\'s running from something too. Haven\'t asked. He hasn\'t asked me either.
