This ability may be used as a Free\nAction on your Turn.",
  "battle captain": "<strong>As a Battle Captain, your presence inspires immediate action.</strong> Once\nper day, you may allow one ally within 10 feet to act out of Initiative\norder at any time during the round (including at the start of the\nInitiative round), essentially acting as an Interrupt action and taking\ntheir place in the normal Initiative order. This still costs Action\nPoints as normal. This may be declared at any time, including during an\nenemy's Turn. This ability only works on allies and not yourself.",
  "war marshal": "You command the battlefield with unmatched authority. Once per day, you\nmay designate a \"Marshal's Zone\" -- a 10-foot radius centered on you\nthat lasts for 1d6 rounds. While within this zone:\n\n• Allies gain +1 Action Point to Parry or Evade, and\n\n• All enemies suffer -1 to Action Points for the Round.\n\nThis is a non-magical zone of command, wholly dependent on your presence\nand vocal projection. It ends immediately if you are silenced, stunned,\nor rendered unconscious.",
  "lord commander": "You are a living legend among warriors. <strong>Once per day, you may invoke\nyour Commander's Call, an overwhelming battlefield declaration that\ninstantly resets one of your expended Rank abilities</strong> (e.g., Inspire\nCourage, Tactical Shift, Supreme Command) and allows it to be used again\nthis combat. Additionally, you and all allies within 15 feet immediately\ngain +1 Action Point. This ability is a Free Action and may be used at\nany time.",
  "legendary master": "Legendary Masters gain additional benefits based on their chosen Weapon\nMaster weapon. See note on the right.",
